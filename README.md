# code-bits

Small and contained bits of code, broken into files or modules or ready to use and implement **working code**.
Avoiding dependencies, these functions, classes or procedures are built as ready to copy into any project as-is and can be adapted or used directly.

The collection is completely random, with any potentially useful code dropped here.
